# Contributing / Submitting Work (Students)

Thank you for participating in the Share Network Python Expedition course.

## Preferred submission: GitHub Fork + Pull Request
1) Fork the repository.
2) Create a branch:
   - `submission-<yourname>-a01`
3) Put your solution in:
   - `student-submissions/<your-name>/assignment-01/fizzbuzz.py`
4) Commit & push.
5) Open a Pull Request (PR).

Repeat for A02, A03, and the final project.

## Alternative submission: Google Drive
If GitHub is not possible, submit via Google Drive:
- Create folder: `Python Expedition - <Your Name>`
- Add subfolders: Assignment-01, Assignment-02, Assignment-03, Final-Project
- Upload your code files.
- Share the folder link with the instructor.

## File naming
Use the exact filenames required in each assignment README.

## Getting help
You may discuss ideas, but the final code must be your own.
